# apicustomtemplate
Custom Template to allow devs create a backend for Accelerator and MobileX

The idea is that you clone this repo and then modify the routes/demo.js file to add your own logic.

You can then run the app using npm start and it will run on port 3003.

You can then access the app at http://localhost:3003
